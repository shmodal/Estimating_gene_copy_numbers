# Estimating genomic copy number with hidden Markov Models

The goal of this project was to solve a genomic problem using statistical tools. We were interested in the variability of genomic copy numbers, 
which may be a cause of cancer. We modelized the copy numbers using Hidden Markov Models, and estimated these numbers through Markov chain Monte Carlo(MCMC).
We finally applied this methodology to real data obtained from rats.
